As much as fun as redoing work is, its not going to happen on this one. Check out virt-manager's screenshot walkthrough on installing machines via virt-manager. Its actually just a wizard that walks you through the install. It really just takes playing around with to discover all the cool stuff you can do with it, like adding virtual networks, adding multiple virtual hard disks, adding virtual cd-rom drives, etc.

Definitely want to be familiar with this app in general though. As you study for the exam, this is great for spinning up machines for practice. Of course you have to be running a linux distro as your main OS, but who isn't right? ;-)
