Input output redirection is one of the base skills you will need as a sysadmin. On the exam you will have to be able to redirect data from one command into another, and/or into a file. 

 <code>~$ echo "this is input" > file.txt</code>

Another common example:

 <code>cat /var/log/messages | less</code>


Here are a couple of good tutorials already written on this:
