Starting and stopping virtual machines is just like starting and stopping real machines. 

The only main difference, is that you can start and stop them right from the . [Virtual Machine Manager](http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/index.html)

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Virtual Machine Manager has a fairly intuitive graphical user interface, with obvious start and stop buttons for each machine. If you haven't used it at all, It would be good to download a trial copy of Red Hat, to get an idea of how to navigate the program.

You can see in the screenshot the Run, Pause, and Shutdown buttons.
