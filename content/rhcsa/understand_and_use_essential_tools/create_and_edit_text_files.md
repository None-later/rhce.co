Using a command line text editor is a skill that is absolutely necessary. Without it most tasks cannot be performed. The default editor used it vim. vim is a enhanced version of vi, which is not quite as pretty as vim. 

To use vim simply type vim and then the filename

    :::bash
    $ vim filename.txt

There are options that can be given such as:

* -R Open in read-only
* -b Start in binary mode

There is also a list of options for using vim once you are editing, to move around and actually edit. It may seem cumbersome at first, but once you are used to vim you will love it.

Check out the man page for more options: [vim](http://amath.colorado.edu/computing/software/man/vim.html)
