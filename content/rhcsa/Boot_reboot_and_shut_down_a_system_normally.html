Basically, they are referring to these actions on the command line. I'm sure everyone is able to do this on a pc, but not necessarily a live Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server remotely. 

The commands are simple for the server. 

Normal reboot

 <code>$ sudo reboot</code>

Another way

 <code>$ sudo shutdown -r now</code>

Changing to init 6 will reboot as well, which is what init 6 does. 

 <code>$ sudo init 6</code>

On the same note, init 0 calls all of the shutdown scripts and gracefully shuts down your machine.

 <code>$ sudo init 0</code>

Surprisingly you can also use the shutdown command to shutdown completely by using the -h switch.

 <code>$ sudo shutdown -h</code>

I think we all know how to boot the computer, so that shouldn't be a problem. :-)
