*`system-config-firewall`* is a good way to get rules up quick. But if you are not intimately familiar with the way the rules work, you may not be able to tweak them to the specifications on the exam, and end up in trouble.

Iptables is a big topic, and no way I could cover it on this page, nor would I need to. Here is a good page on the Centos Wiki that goes through iptables on a RHEL-based system in great detail.
