title: Use /proc/sys and sysctl to modify and set kernel runtime parameters.

Modifying and setting kernel runtime parameters is a simple process. To list the current kernel options you can use <code> sysctl -a </code>
Once you've found the option you want to set, you'll want to edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add the parameter (you can add parameters temporarily, but for the RHCE exam this is quite pointless since your changes must be persistant).

A common option to modify within the sysctl.conf is net.ipv4.ip_forward, it is the first item on the list for a reason, as it is needed for many applications and is a common setting to modify. To make your changes edit the sysctl.conf, and change <code> net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 </code> to <code> net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 </code> (You will need to be root, or use sudo to perform this action)

Once you've edited the file, don't forget to reload sysctly. As you can see here, I've edited my file, but the changes aren't yet active.

<code> [root@testbox ~]$ sysctl -a | grep ip_forward
	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
</code>

Run <code> sysctl -p </code> as the root, or a privileged user to reload the configuration without restarting the server.
